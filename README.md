# STM32-rectenna

Portable measurement system, based on an STM32f303re microcontroller. It was build to measure radio noise collected via rectenna.
This data was then used as a source of entropy in a random number generator based on the work of [Pierre L'Ecuyer](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer/myftp/papers/tausme2.ps). The content of this project was the result of a diploma thesis.
